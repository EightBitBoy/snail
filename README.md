# snl / snail
`snl` ("snail") slows the output down, think `tail -f` but at a configurable constant output rate üêå

Slow down the output of logs and other text streams in your terminal and make them easier to follow.

## Installation
* The application is available at `crates.io`: [https://crates.io/crates/snl](https://crates.io/crates/snl)
* `cargo install snl`

## Build
* `cargo build`

## Usage
`snl` is the right tool for you if you view logs in real-time but the output is simply too fast to follow or comes in bursts of too many lines. With `snl` you can specify how many *lines per second* should appear on your termal.

Per default `snl` prints out *2 lines per second*, the rate is configurable.

`snl` reads from a single file or from `stdin`.

* Tail a log file: `snl /some/file.log`
* Use `snl` as a target for a pipe: `tail -f server.log | grep "error" | snl`
* Watch an application log, 5 lines per second: `snl /application.log -r 5`
